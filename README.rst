Kai's Dotfiles
##############

A collection of the dotfiles that I use in my daily life. Contains dotfiles
for:

  * git
  * vim
  * zsh
  * i3
  * luakit
  * mutt
  * ncmpcpp
  * tmux

And more. A lot of them need submodule updates, particularly the vim repo.
And for the YouCompleteMe you have to run the install script.
